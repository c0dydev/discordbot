# My bot for Discord

So yeah I was bored and decided to make this xd




# how 2 use:

install node.js and Visual Studio Code on your pc

extract the files

hold shift and click the mouse2 button

click "open command window here"

type "npm install discord.js --save" and click enter

now wait a bit

when its installed you need to go to the last line in the index.js file and replace 'yourtoken' with your bot's token

now the second to last step, open the run.bat file

that's pretty much it.
